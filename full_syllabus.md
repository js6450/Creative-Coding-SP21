### Pre-requisites

None.

### Course Description

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no prior programming experience. Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking – to think concurrently and modularly and ask questions about how computation can reflect creative potential. By semster end, students are empowered to write and read code for event-driven, object-oriented, experiences and connect them to the physical world.

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, students will :

- Understand the basics of creative coding in Javascript using p5.js.
- Write code within the context of visual art and design
- Apply their understanding of digital media to software.
- Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real time framework.
- Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.

### IDM Program Objectives

Students will:

- Develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities in art and design.
- Develop technical skills to realize their ideas.
- Develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
- Gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.
- Develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### Course Structure

While we will be meeting weekly in class, technical lectures will be provided as online videos for you to go through at your own pace each week. You will have homework assignments based on these videos. We will spend time in class reinforcing the concepts that are covered, talk about how these relate to other topics, and conduct ourselves in a format that is conducive to conversation and group learning. Bringing your work to demonstrate and show is one part of this process, being open to critique, and willing to enagge other people abotu their work is another part. The success of this course depends quite a bit on your participation.

There will be weekly readings to accoompany these videos, you should be prepared to discuss them in class. These will not be technical in nature. They are meant to provoke and excite you about the possibilities of using code as part of your practice.

### Software

- A code editor like [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_841432) or similar
- The [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- An account with the [p5.js online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)

### Hardware

We’ll be distributing equipment to you all soon.

### Grading and Attendance Policy

The assignments are designed to test and deepen your knowledge while giving me valuable information about how you’re progressing in the class. Remember, **finished is better than perfect**. An attempt at an assignment that does not meet your expectations is better than nothing at all.

You are expected to push yourself, be curious, and be challenged every week. If you have previous programming experience, this means you will be expected to “go beyond” the assignment, and interpret what a next step (or steps) would be for yourself. If you have no programming experience, that’s fine too! This course is made for you, and you should find yourself exploring means of creative expression that are novel to you.

Practice makes perfect. The more time you spend writing code and playing with these tools, the better versed you will be come in their possibilities. I suggest that instead of spending 8 hours the night before class trying to cram in everything, you spend time each day practicing programming.

Your in-class participation counts towards your grade. This means you are expected to be actively engaged in class discussions, attentive to other students, and mentally present in the classroom and on excursions. We will be having active discussions in class. If you are not naturally a talker, this is your chance to become one.

#### Absences and tardiness

Your attendance is important. Notify me of all absences prior to class. If you have one or two unexcused absence, each will impact your final grade by a third of a letter (ex. one unexcused absence will drop a final grade of A- to B+, two unexcused absences would drop that A- to a B). If you have three or more unexcused absences, you fail the course automatically.

If you’re more than 5 minutes late for class, you will be considered tardy. Two instances of tardiness = one unexcused absence.

#### Grade breakdown

- Weekly code assignments - 10%
- Reading responses - 10%
- Midterm - 25%
- Final - 35%
- Class participation - 20%

##### Midterm

Your midterm assignment is designed to demonstrate competency in the fundamentals of object oriented programming. We will discuss the specifics of this a few weeks before it is due. You will make your own interactive, screen based artwork. Your sketch needs to contain at least 2 objects (they can be from the same class) that behave independently from one another. Taking into consideration responsiveness, accessibility, and aesthetics there should be some form of interaction for your audience. This could be through keypresses, mouse movements, GUI objects, etc. You should feel free to use APIs libraries or any other thing we ave discussed in class to date. You coude *must* be clearly and thoroughly commented througout - indicating what is your original contribution and what you have gotten from elsewhere.

##### Final

Your final project is wide open. This is your opportunity to create work that leverages the various tools, techniques and ideas we have explored throughout the semester. This includes interaction, data, design, computer vision, interfaces, games, or any number of alternative forms of expression. You should create work that is engaging and compelling for your audience. Use this as an excuse to ask a question using computation, or to scratch an itch you’ve always wanted to explore. We will spend several weeks at the end of the semester working through your ideas on these projects.

The sooner you start to think about and articulate your ideas for projects, the easier it will be for us to do any necessary course correction in the second half of the semester to address your interests.

##### Assignments

Each week you will be asked to create a small project (software sketches or something physical ) and post the link to your work or the documentation of your work online. You must also write a short blog post about the sketch, and react to any readings that are assigned. Blog posts are to be made on an online journal described below. Work is due before the next class meeting. We will spend time during each class going over the assignments, so if you don’t understand a concept, it's best to write about that, put up what you attempted to code, and we can use that as a starting point for class discussion. Late work will be penalized. Every day work is overdue, it loses a letter grade. If work is turned in more than 4 days late, it receives an F. If you turn nothing in at all, you will receive a 0 for the assignment. Nobody wants that, so be sure to turn your work in on time. Anything is better than nothing.

##### Online Journal

You are expected to keep an online journal. The purpose of the journal is twofold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate to me that you are keeping up with the work in the class. I read the site to see how you are doing. At a minimum, reference to your work is expected, as well as reference to the readings, and thorough documentation of any research. Secondly, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use and that of others.

You must update the journal weekly with the work you have done for class. It's generally easiest to do this as you do the work.

Document your projects thoroughly as you go; don’t put it off until the end. Photos, video, drawings, schematics, and notes are all valuable forms of documentation. Explain the project at the beginning of your documentation, so that people who come to your site from outside this class can understand your work quickly.

Don’t overload your notes with code. Code repositories like gitHub are best for sharing code, rather than blogs, so post your code to a repository and link to it from your blog. When you base your code on someone else’s code, cite the original author and link to their code, just as you would when quoting another author in a paper. If you only changed one part of an existing program, post only the part you changed, and link to the original. Make sure any code you post is well-commented, so you and others can understand what it does. *Copying code or techniques without attribution is plagiarism.* Few ideas come out of the blue, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were were inspired. So be generous in sharing your sources.

Good documentation should include a description and illustration of your project. You should include what it looks like, what it does, what the user or participant does in response. When it’s interactive, mention and show what the user does. Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s never seen the project can understand it.

You should also include a section describing how the project works, aimed at a more informed reader (your instructor, or next year’s classmates). Include a system diagram to make clear what the major components of the system are and how they communicate.

### Project and Documentation due: May 12

## Projects

### Week 1: Selfie or Sol

Create one of the following and post a link to the sketch on your website:

- Selfie - Using primitives like arcs, rectangles, and ellipses create a self portrait and post a link to it on your class blog
- Sol Lewitt drawing exercise. As precisely as possible, follow the instructions of one Sol Lewitt wall drawing text and translate it into p5.js code to produce the drawing. Look at [Solving Sol](https://solvingsol.com/) as a reference and for inspiration. Choose one wall drawing text from the following list, write the code and post a link to the project on your class blog:
  - [Wall Drawing #65](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jumpingshark/2910188985) (1971): Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.
  - [Wall Drawing #396](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing396/) (1983): A black five-pointed star, a yellow six-pointed star, a red seven-pointed star, and a blue eight-pointed star, drawn in color and India ink washes.
  - [Wall Drawing #915](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing915/) (1999): Arcs, circle, and irregular bands.

### Week 2: Animation

Create one of the following and post a link to the sketch on your website:

- Make a clock with p5js. Functions like second(), hour() and minute() are useful here! The clock can be [analogous to a real-world clock](https://p5js.org/examples/input-clock.html) or it could be an [abstract way of telling time](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/855977)
- Using your mouse and a simple shape (rect, ellipse, arc, triangle, line, polygon), create an interaction that causes the shape to demonstrate an emotion. It could be fear, attraction, desire, exhaustion. Your choice. Obviously mouseX and mouseY are helpful. Examples like this [easing function](https://p5js.org/examples/input-easing.html) might be inspirational, as would notes from the [12 principles of animation](https://vimeo.com/93206523)

### Week 3: Dance Party

Watch [the video for Around the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKYPYj2XX80) by Daft Punk. While you’re enjoying the music, think about how each of the different dancers/monsters in the video are like an object. They are similar, but have their own behaviors. Create a sketch that has a dance party. Use multiple instances of a class, or create multiple classes and many objects thsat have their own dance party. Your idea of a dance party may not have actual bodies, that’s ok. Explore different kinds of ways of creating objects with unique behaviors. Post this on your class site.

### Week 4: Interaction

Create a sketch that adds objects based on interaction (mousepress, keystroke, etc) that interact with each other (collision, repulsion, etc.) *or* create a sketch that makes faces which have multiple dimensions of variability (skin color, eyes, ears, mouth, hair, age, etc). A new face should eb created everytime you click the mouse. For either example, write the sketch as pseudo-code first, then fill in your code afterwards.

### Week 5: Data

Create a sketch that calls an API, processes the data, and visualizes it somehow. A non-exhaistive list of [publically available APIs can be found here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

### Week 6: Library

Create a small sketch that uses a library to enahnce a sketch. For example, use the DOM to create sliders or buttons for interfaces, use peasycam to navigate a 3D space, use p5.scribble to mimic hand drawn images, etc etc etc.

### Midterm

Your midterm assignment is designed to demonstrate competency in the fundamentals of object oriented programming. We will discuss the specifics of this a few weeks before it is due. You will make your own interactive, screen based artwork. Your sketch needs to contain at least 2 objects (they can be from the same class) that behave independently from one another. Taking into consideration responsiveness, accessibility, and aesthetics there should be some form of interaction for your audience. This could be through keypresses, mouse movements, GUI objects, etc. You should feel free to use APIs libraries or any other thing we ave discussed in class to date. You coude *must* be clearly and thoroughly commented througout - indicating what is your original contribution and what you have gotten from elsewhere.

### Week 8: Switch

Build a circuit with a switch you make on your own that can be operated without using your hands. Think about what you have that is conductive. Aluminum foil works well. Be careful you do not cause a short! Always unplug your Arduino before changing anything in your circuit, and check to make sure there are no loose wires.

### Week 9: Feedback

With the switch you built last week (or a different one if you want to experiment) use the Arduino to provide some meaningful feedback on what the action you engage in means. For example — if you are trying to notify someone that their posture is good or bad, could you make a switch that was based on how they stood, and notify them if they are not straight? What about gettting someone to smile for a camera? Using the digital input and output provide feedback to your user that is meaningful in context. Labeling LEDs with text, or using different colored lights to indicate things is helpful, try diffusing the light with paper or a ping pong ball, how does that change the quality of the light?

### Week 10: Love Compatibility Machine

Make a love compatibility machine. Using analog input and/or analog output, make a love compatiability machine. This could be 2 photocells that have an LED as an output, or a pair of buttons that enagge a servo motor, or one photocell that people need to clasp hands over, or anything else that demonstrates how to display how compatiable people are.

### Week 11: Sketch with Physical Interface

Build a sketch with a physical interface - take one of your early p5 sketches and make it controllable with a switch, pot or photocell using serial or bluetooth communcation. Alternatively, create a new p5 sketch that reacts to soem sort of input. How does this change in control transform the exerience of using the sketch?

### Final

Your final project is wide open. This is your opportunity to create work that leverages the various tools, techniques and ideas we have explored throughout the semester. This includes interaction, data, design, computer vision, interfaces, games, or any number of alternative forms of expression. You should create work that is engaging and compelling for your audience. Use this as an excuse to ask a question using computation, or to scratch an itch you’ve always wanted to explore. We will spend several weeks at the end of the semester working through your ideas on these projects.

The sooner you start to think about and articulate your ideas for projects, the easier it will be for us to do any necessary course correction in the second half of the semester to address your interests.
