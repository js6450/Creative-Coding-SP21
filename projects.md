## Projects

### Week 1: Selfie or Sol

Create one of the following and post a link to the sketch on your website:

- Selfie - Using primitives like arcs, rectangles, and ellipses create a self portrait and post a link to it on your class blog
- Sol Lewitt drawing exercise. As precisely as possible, follow the instructions of one Sol Lewitt wall drawing text and translate it into p5.js code to produce the drawing. Look at [Solving Sol](https://solvingsol.com/) as a reference and for inspiration. Choose one wall drawing text from the following list, write the code and post a link to the project on your class blog:
  - [Wall Drawing #65](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jumpingshark/2910188985) (1971): Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.
  - [Wall Drawing #396](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing396/) (1983): A black five-pointed star, a yellow six-pointed star, a red seven-pointed star, and a blue eight-pointed star, drawn in color and India ink washes.
  - [Wall Drawing #915](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing915/) (1999): Arcs, circle, and irregular bands.

### Week 2: Animation

Create one of the following and post a link to the sketch on your website:

- Make a clock with p5js. Functions like second(), hour() and minute() are useful here! The clock can be [analogous to a real-world clock](https://p5js.org/examples/input-clock.html) or it could be an [abstract way of telling time](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/855977)
- Using your mouse and a simple shape (rect, ellipse, arc, triangle, line, polygon), create an interaction that causes the shape to demonstrate an emotion. It could be fear, attraction, desire, exhaustion. Your choice. Obviously mouseX and mouseY are helpful. Examples like this [easing function](https://p5js.org/examples/input-easing.html) might be inspirational, as would notes from the [12 principles of animation](https://vimeo.com/93206523)

### Week 3: Dance Party

Watch [the video for Around the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKYPYj2XX80) by Daft Punk. While you’re enjoying the music, think about how each of the different dancers/monsters in the video are like an object. They are similar, but have their own behaviors. Create a sketch that has a dance party. Use multiple instances of a class, or create multiple classes and many objects thsat have their own dance party. Your idea of a dance party may not have actual bodies, that’s ok. Explore different kinds of ways of creating objects with unique behaviors. Post this on your class site.

### Week 4: Interaction

Create a sketch that adds objects based on interaction (mousepress, keystroke, etc) that interact with each other (collision, repulsion, etc.) *or* create a sketch that makes faces which have multiple dimensions of variability (skin color, eyes, ears, mouth, hair, age, etc). A new face should eb created everytime you click the mouse. For either example, write the sketch as pseudo-code first, then fill in your code afterwards.

### Week 5: Data

Create a sketch that calls an API, processes the data, and visualizes it somehow. A non-exhaistive list of [publically available APIs can be found here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

### Week 6: Library

Create a small sketch that uses a library to enahnce a sketch. For example, use the DOM to create sliders or buttons for interfaces, use peasycam to navigate a 3D space, use p5.scribble to mimic hand drawn images, etc etc etc.

### Midterm

Your midterm assignment is designed to demonstrate competency in the fundamentals of object oriented programming. We will discuss the specifics of this a few weeks before it is due. You will make your own interactive, screen based artwork. Your sketch needs to contain at least 2 objects (they can be from the same class) that behave independently from one another. Taking into consideration responsiveness, accessibility, and aesthetics there should be some form of interaction for your audience. This could be through keypresses, mouse movements, GUI objects, etc. You should feel free to use APIs libraries or any other thing we ave discussed in class to date. You coude *must* be clearly and thoroughly commented througout - indicating what is your original contribution and what you have gotten from elsewhere.

### Week 8: Switch

Build a circuit with a switch you make on your own that can be operated without using your hands. Think about what you have that is conductive. Aluminum foil works well. Be careful you do not cause a short! Always unplug your Arduino before changing anything in your circuit, and check to make sure there are no loose wires.

### Week 9: Feedback

With the switch you built last week (or a different one if you want to experiment) use the Arduino to provide some meaningful feedback on what the action you engage in means. For example — if you are trying to notify someone that their posture is good or bad, could you make a switch that was based on how they stood, and notify them if they are not straight? What about gettting someone to smile for a camera? Using the digital input and output provide feedback to your user that is meaningful in context. Labeling LEDs with text, or using different colored lights to indicate things is helpful, try diffusing the light with paper or a ping pong ball, how does that change the quality of the light?

### Week 10: Love Compatibility Machine

Make a love compatibility machine. Using analog input and/or analog output, make a love compatiability machine. This could be 2 photocells that have an LED as an output, or a pair of buttons that enagge a servo motor, or one photocell that people need to clasp hands over, or anything else that demonstrates how to display how compatiable people are.

### Week 11: Sketch with Physical Interface

Build a sketch with a physical interface - take one of your early p5 sketches and make it controllable with a switch, pot or photocell using serial or bluetooth communcation. Alternatively, create a new p5 sketch that reacts to soem sort of input. How does this change in control transform the exerience of using the sketch?

### Final

Your final project is wide open. This is your opportunity to create work that leverages the various tools, techniques and ideas we have explored throughout the semester. This includes interaction, data, design, computer vision, interfaces, games, or any number of alternative forms of expression. You should create work that is engaging and compelling for your audience. Use this as an excuse to ask a question using computation, or to scratch an itch you’ve always wanted to explore. We will spend several weeks at the end of the semester working through your ideas on these projects.

The sooner you start to think about and articulate your ideas for projects, the easier it will be for us to do any necessary course correction in the second half of the semester to address your interests.
